# Machine Learning Query System via Django
- This is an image classification system for HW1 of **Security and Privacy of Machine Learning**.
- Five adversarially trained models are provided for evaluating images uploaded by users.
    - Students need to generate adversarial examples (images) with enough attacking strength to make pre-trained models mis-classify.
    - Each submission is in **.zip** format containing no more than **500** images.
    - Each student has only 10 submissions per day.
- An csv file of the classification results on each submitted image will be provided after each submission.
